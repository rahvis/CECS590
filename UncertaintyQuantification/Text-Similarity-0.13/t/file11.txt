The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) confirmed on Thursday that Pakistan would host the Asia Cup one-day tournament from June 24 to July 6. ACC backing for Pakistan came the week after Australia postponed their tour, which was due to start at the end of March, because of the troubled security situation. ACC chief executive Ashraf-ul-Haque told a news conference Pakistan and India would play in the same group in the six-team tournament which will be held in Karachi and Lahore.
