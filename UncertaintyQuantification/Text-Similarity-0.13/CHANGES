NAME
    CHANGES - Revision history for Text::Similarity

DESCRIPTION
    0.13
        Released October 7, 2015 (all changes by TDP)

        *   Misc pod fixes, primarily those reported by Alex Becker to bug
            list.

    0.11
        Released October 6, 2015 (all changes by TDP)

        *   Contributed enhancement by Tani Hosokawa : Not a bug, but an
            optimization. Original version does inefficient repeated linear
            search over text that can't possibly match. Instead, precaches
            locations of keywords. Comparing 100 semi-randomly generated
            fairly similar documents of about 500 words each results in
            approx 90% speed increase, the efficiency increases as the
            documents get larger.

        *   Make various documentation/typo fixes as suggested by Alex
            Becker. Found in CPAN bug list.

    0.10
        Released June 26, 2013

        *   Version 0.09 did not fix the windows testing error that we
            thought was fixed in 0.09. We think it has been fixed now. :)

    0.09
        Released January 22, 2013

        *   This release includes changes contributed by Myroslava Dzikovska
            that provide the full set of similarity scores programmatically.
            She modified the interface so that the getSimilarity function
            returns a pair ($score, %allScores) where %allScores is a hash
            of all possible scores that it computes. She made it so that in
            scalar context it will only return $score, so it is fully
            backwards compatible with the older versions. She also changed
            the printing to STDERR, to make it easier to use the code in
            filter scripts that depend on STDIN/STDOUT.

        *   This release also inludes changes ontributed by Nathan Glen to
            allow test cases to pass on Windows. The single quote used
            previously caused arguments to the script not to be passed
            corrected, leading to test failures. The single quotes have been
            changed to double quotes.

    0.08
        Released June 11, 2010 (all changes by YL)

        *   Changed the stoplist option. stoplist file can be one word per
            line or one word in the regular expression format per line, or
            the mix of these two formats.

    0.07
        Released November 14, 2008 (all changes by TDP)

        *   Changed test case that was tripping up Windows. In Linux these
            are treated as being the same (when order doesn't matter) but
            this is not the case in Windows.

                    'sir winston churchill' 'winston churchill SIR!!!'

            The case has been changed to :

                    'sir winston churchill' 'winston churchill sir'

    0.06
        Released April 5, 2008 (all changes by TDP)

        *   Added Dice coefficient to Overlaps.pm output. Dice is equivalent
            to F-measure, but formulated slightly differently so could be
            useful to catch errors.

        *   Modified Overlaps method to provide lesk text matching score,
            that is the sum of the squared lengths of all phrasal matches
            (optionally normalized by the product of the lengths of the
            strings). It provides both Raw lesk and lesk (the normalized
            form) when run in verbose mode.

        *   Reogranized some documentation to make it more clear that
            Overlaps is just one possible way of measuring similarity, and
            that other methods can and should be added.

        *   Renamed text_compare.pl as the more natural and fitting
            text_similarity.pl

    0.05
        Released April 4, 2008 (all changes by TDP)

        *   Made it possible for users to input strings directly via
            text_compare.pl and getSimilarityStrings. Previously it was only
            possible to directly measure the similarity of files, but now
            strings can be measured.

    0.04
        Released March 21, 2008 (all changes by TDP)

        *   Introduced tests for text_compare.pl (t/text_compare.t) - added
            support for os neutral file reads via FILE::SPEC in this and
            other .t files.

        *   Introduced tests for getOverlaps (t/overlaps.t)

        *   Improved synopsis examples to show how to pass options via
            arguments in hashes

        *   Clarified that stemming and compounding are not currently
            supported disabled compfile option in text_compare.pl

        *   Made file handling in text_compare more robust so that when a
            file does not exist an error message is given and failure is
            immediate

        *   Changed method of passing constants in test cases from (eg.)
            "Text::Similarity::NORMALIZE" to "normalize" in order to support
            backwards compatability with perl 5.6.

        *   Introduce normalize and no-normalize tests for getSimilarity

        *   Fix Similarity.pm Synopsis example not to use files in /t that
            are no longer available

    0.03
        Released March 20, 2008 (all changes by TDP)

        *   fix divide by zero errors reported on cpan by cernst at
            esoft.com, who also provided fix

        *   update test cases to improve coverage of partial matches and no
            matches

        *   update synopsis examples so they can be run via cut and paste

        *   improve README content to make it more descriptive

        *   introduce /doc directory for pod of INSTALL README and CHANGES

        *   introduce 'use constant' to support perl 5.6

    0.02

        *   improved command-line interface

        *   improved documentation and help messages

        *   added support for a stoplist

    0.01

        *   original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options -b 5.6.0 -A
