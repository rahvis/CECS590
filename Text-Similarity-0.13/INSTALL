NAME
    INSTALL - Installation instructions for Text::Similarity

SYNOPSIS
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

DESCRIPTION
  Dependencies
    None

  Detailed Installation Instructions
    If you have superuser (root) access, you should be able to install
    Text::Similarity by following these simple steps:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test  # optional, but recommended
        su         # or sudo, as the case may be
        make install

    If you need to install this distribution in your local user account
    because you lack superuser privileges, then the recommended method on
    Unix-like systems (Linux, Solaris, Cygwin) is as follows:

        perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/Text-Similarity LIB=~/MyPerlLib
        make
        make test
        make install

    This will install the executable scripts into ~/Text-Similarity/bin, the
    man pages in ~/Text-Similarity/man, and the libraries into ~/MyPerlLib.

    You will need to set your PERL5LIB variable to point to the LIB
    directory.

    In bash:

        export PERL5LIB=~/MyPerlLib

    In csh or tcsh:

        setenv PERL5LIB ~/MyPerlLib

    Add these lines to your .bashrc, .bash_profile, or .cshrc files as the
    case may be.
