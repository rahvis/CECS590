=head2 Detailed Installation Instructions

If you have superuser (root) access, you should be able to install
Text::Similarity by following these simple steps:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test  # optional, but recommended
    su         # or sudo, as the case may be
    make install

If you need to install this distribution in your local user account
because you lack superuser privileges, then the recommended method
on Unix-like systems (Linux, Solaris, Cygwin) is as follows:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/Text-Similarity LIB=~/MyPerlLib
    make
    make test
    make install

This will install the executable scripts into ~/Text-Similarity/bin, 
the man pages in ~/Text-Similarity/man, and the libraries into 
~/MyPerlLib.  

You will need to set your PERL5LIB variable to point to the LIB directory.

In bash:

    export PERL5LIB=~/MyPerlLib

In csh or tcsh:

    setenv PERL5LIB ~/MyPerlLib

Add these lines to your .bashrc, .bash_profile, or .cshrc files as the
case may be.
